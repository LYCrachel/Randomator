# Randomator
> A builder and pseudo random string generator for Servrian and Maze. I plan to make it transparent and safe to generate a key, insert it in the code and build the project, so no one can ever see the key used.

##  How to use this

This piece of code is meant to automate the build of Servrian and Maze, two projects of mine, by generating pseudo random strings and running build scripts.

### Build Randomator

To buid this project is enough to enter its folder and issue `make`.

### Build Servrian and Maze

Both projects must be built together, otherwise they won't share the same key and won't work correctly, to buid enter the _Randomator_ folder and issue `make all`.

## Requirements

This project must be placed together with Servrian and Maze, under the same folder. Other requirements are described in those projects' pages.

## Current work

- Coding the string generator;
- Creating version information; &
- Automating the creation of encryption keys.

## To-do

There are lots of things to do, the ones in my mind now are listed below.

- Prepare to upcoming projects.
